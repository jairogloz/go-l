# Contributing to [âš½ GO-L](https://github.com/jairogloz/go-l)

Thank you for considering contributing to [GO-L]! We appreciate your efforts and contributions to improving our project. Please follow these guidelines to contribute effectively.

## Rule #1
Be sure to always keep your fork/branch up to date with the original repository.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Project**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[project-name].git
      cd [project-name]
      ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
   ```sh
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Link the Related Issue**: If there is an existing issue related to your work, link it in your commit messages and pull requests. 
    ```sh 
    git commit -m "Fixes #[issue-number]: [description of the fix]"
    ````
   
5. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: Commit your changes and push the branch to your fork. 
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add new feature [feature-description]"
    git push origin feat/your-feature-name
    ```
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and create a pull request from your forked branch to the develop branch of the original repository.
    Provide a clear description of the changes and link any related issues.

    If you haven't done it already, associate the issue with the pull request. You can do this by adding the issue number in the pull request description or comments or by going to the "Development" section of your pull request and choosing the issue from the "Linked Issues" dropdown.

7. **Wait for Review**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be responsive to feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## How to Claim an Issue if you're not yet a collaborator
1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before starting work, check the [Issues](https://github.com/jairogloz/go-l/issues) section to see if the issue you want to work on is already claimed or in progress.

2. **Comment on the Issue**: If the issue is not already assigned, comment on the issue expressing your interest in working on it. Example:

    ```
    @maintainers, I would like to work on this issue.
    ```

3. **Wait for Assignment**: Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue to you. This helps prevent multiple people from working on the same issue simultaneously.
4. **Start Working on the Issue**: Once the issue is assigned, feel free to start working on it. If you need help or have questions, don't hesitate to leave a comment on the issue.

## How to Claim an Issue if you're a collaborator
1. **Check Existing Issues or Tasks**: If you're already a collaborator, chances are you're allowed to self-assign an issue from the [Issues](https://github.com/jairogloz/go-l/issues) section.

    Or...

    Self assign a task from the [project board](https://github.com/users/jairogloz/projects/5). this second option is the most recommended.
2. **Move the task to "In Progress"**: Once you've claimed the issue, move it to the "In Progress" column on the project board. This will help other collaborators know that you're working on it.
3. **Start doing your magic**: Start working on the issue. If you need help or have questions, don't hesitate to ask in the issue comments.
